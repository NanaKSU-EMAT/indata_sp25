MILESTONE 1 RELECTION 

Following my steps for my first milestone which was to gather the data which I would be using for my visualization I obtained most of my data from FBREF.com and Opta analyst, 
further analyzing I saw potential that a story could be told but how I want it done in my head was not really reflecting in my attempts on the notebook. 

Before finding real data I attempted visualization with simulated data which obtained from Chatgpt randomizing some and the results were not what I had in mind and deleted it (this was before Mr.Silvaâ€™s prompt to not delete our attempts hence the question I asked during that class). 
Going at it again with the real data I made progress somewhat but feel like the simplicity is not going to deliver what I want to tell or how I want the audience to interact with my visualization. 
I did find an educative video lesson from a UI design perspective in sports which I would want to try and incorporate during milestone 2

Moving further the next milestone I would want to develop my visualizations to allow even non-sports fans to understand what is trying to be explained, 
which is my main goal for this whole project.
